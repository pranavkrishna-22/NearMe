<h2>Ashok Pillar is a prominent landmark located in Chennai, Tamil Nadu, India. It is a tall stone pillar inspired by the famous Ashoka Pillars erected by Emperor Ashoka during the Maurya dynasty around 3rd century BCE. The Ashok Pillar in Chennai, however, is a modern structure built to commemorate the ideals of peace, non-violence, and unity that Emperor Ashoka promoted.
    Located in the Ashok Nagar area, the pillar is beautifully designed with carvings and the iconic Lion Capital at the top, which is also Indiaâ€™s national emblem. The surrounding area, known as Ashok Nagar, is a well-developed residential and commercial locality. The pillar stands as a symbol of heritage and cultural pride and is a notable spot for locals and visitors alike.
    Today, Ashok Pillar is not just a historical monument but also a bustling hub with parks, shopping centers, and important city roads around it.
